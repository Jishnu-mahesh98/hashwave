The moment you enter, you'll be able to envision kick-starting your mornings scanning your socials, while taking in a sea view. Strolling through the palatial 1,371 sq. ft floorplan you'll discover a pile of core attributes that include a purpose-built kitchen, a main bedroom that can comfortably fit a large bed, and an elegant sitting room that is tailor-made for lazily browsing away the hours. This home distinguishes itself because of its conveniences, starting with bathed-in-light floor-to-ceiling windows, app-adjustable air conditioning, and 1 vehicle parking space. It also incorporates a gym for your outdoor and leisure activities. Which means excess calories are a thing of the past. And then there is the outdoor space, which includes an uncovered veranda that is great for catching up with your friends. With all this on offer, this is exactly the kind of apartment that even time stops to take notice. I invite you to view the property at your earliest convenience. Pick up the phone and call me to find out more information."

Its business focuses on acquiring, developing, leasing, managing and maintaining residential and commercial properties. For Further Information Kindly call :-Mr DharamMr RajeshProperty Specifications:-Al Nahda (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u062f\u0629) is a locality in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Located in eastern Dubai in Deira, Al Nahda forms part of Dubai's eastern border with the emirate of Sharjah. Portions of Al Nahda that flow north into the emirate of Sharjah fall within that emirate's jurisdiction. Al Nahda, literally meaning The Awakening, is bordered to the south and east by Al Qusais, and to the west by Al Mamzar. Like Muhaisnah, the community was originally carved out of the industrial areas of Al Qusais, but it has undergone extensive and mostly residential development in recent years. Landmarks include Dubai Women's College, Al Nahda Pond Park, Expo Centre Sharjah, Sahara Centre (the largest Mall in the Emirates of Sharjah), the Khalid Lake, Al Majas Island, and the Mamzar Beach Park."

It is located southwest of Bur Dubai and adjacent to Sheikh Zayed Road. Originally, its residents were mainly of the Baloch tribe. As the government provided better houses for emaratis staying here, only few Arabs are found residing here. Notable features include the Iranian Hospital, Satwa Grand Mosque and the Al Satwa bus terminal. Al Satwa is known for its large South Asian community, especially Filipino Nationals. It is often referred to as mini-Manila by Filipino community. E 11 (Sheikh Zayed Road) forms the southern boundary of Al Satwa, Jumeirah 1 borders its northern area. With the announcement of Jumeirah Garden City, the survival of this community is bleak. If the project goes through, the community will be razed to make way for part of the new development. Some soil testing has already been done for a few of the proposed buildings, most notably EP 09 Towers and 1 Park Avenue."

As a rule of thumb Al Barsha 1 is largely apartment based, while Al Barsha 2 and 3 are home to larger villas and much quieter. Many residents of Al Barsha 2 and 3 appreciate the price of the villas on offer, which tend to be a degree cheaper than similar offerings on the other side of Sheikh Zayed Road. Villas are also less likely to be cookie cutter developments, and have often been built as standalone entities."

It is located southwest of Bur Dubai and adjacent to Sheikh Zayed Road. Originally, its residents were mainly of the Baloch tribe. As the government provided better houses for emaratis staying here, only few Arabs are found residing here. Notable features include the Iranian Hospital, Satwa Grand Mosque and the Al Satwa bus terminal. Al Satwa is known for its large South Asian community, especially Filipino Nationals. It is often referred to as mini-Manila by Filipino community. E 11 (Sheikh Zayed Road) forms the southern boundary of Al Satwa, Jumeirah 1 borders its northern area. With the announcement of Jumeirah Garden City, the survival of this community is bleak. If the project goes through, the community will be razed to make way for part of the new development. Some soil testing has already been done for a few of the proposed buildings, most notably EP 09 Towers and 1 Park Avenue."
